ECECEC


This is a chess engine I wrote in C after I taught myself C in Spring of 2021. I love chess and programming and I am interested in advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence. I wanted hands-on experience so I decided to build a chess playing engine. The name ECECEC stands for "Elias Cannesson's Engine of Chess for Extra Credit". 

Currently ECECEC rivals me in some of its games. I would give it a rough ELO of 1700-1800. The engine will play but it's not entirely finished, I still need to program repetition-of-moves draws and I also need to give the engine a database of chess theory that it can draw from in the openings.

To use my engine, download the code, extract the zip file and navigate to the ECECEC folder via your terminal. Then simply enter "make" into the terminal to execute the Makefile and wait for ECECEC to compile. When you are ready to play, enter ./chessAI in the terminal. Once the program runs, enter "help" for a list of commands to use the engine.
