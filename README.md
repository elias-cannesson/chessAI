ECECEC


This is a chess engine I wrote in C after I taught myself C in Spring of 2021. I wanted hands-on experience so I decided to build a chess playing engine. I used the Chess AI wiki as guidance and youtube videos. The name ECECEC stands for "Elias Cannesson's Engine of Chess for Extra Credit". Very bad name. 

Currently ECECEC rivals me in some of its games. I would give it a rough ELO of 1700-1800. The engine will play but it's not entirely finished, I still need to program repetition-of-moves draws and I also need to give the engine a database of chess theory that it can draw from in the openings.

To use my engine, download the code, extract the zip file and navigate to the ECECEC folder via your terminal. Then simply enter "make" into the terminal to execute the Makefile and wait for ECECEC to compile. When you are ready to play, enter ./chessAI in the terminal. Once the program runs, enter "help" for a list of commands to use the engine.
